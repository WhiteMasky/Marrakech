## Code Review

Reviewing code written by: **Yichi Zhang**, u7748799

Component: `moveAssam()`method in Marrakech.java and `moveNorth()`method in Assam.java

### Comments 

**What are the best features of this code?**

Modularity: The code is structured in a modular fashion. Each direction of movement (North, South, East, West) has its dedicated method. This makes the code easier to read and maintain, as each method handles a specific task.
Abstraction: The moveAssam method acts as a public interface that abstracts away the details of Assam's movement. Users of this method don't need to know the specifics of how Assam moves; they just need to provide the current state and the die result.

**Is the code well-documented?**
The moveAssam method is well-documented with a detailed comment explaining its purpose, parameters, and expected behavior.
However, the moveNorth method lacks documentation. It would be beneficial to have comments explaining its logic, especially given the nested conditional statements.

**Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?**

Yes,the decomposition seems appropriate with methods dedicated to specific movement directions.

**Does it follow Java code conventions (for example, are methods and variables properly named), and is the style consistent throughout?** 

The method names are descriptive and follow the camelCase convention.
The variable names are also descriptive (dieResult, currentAssam, directions).
There's a consistency issue with the use of spaces and indentation. For instance, the else block in moveNorth is not consistently indented.
The comment //注意 这里直接加减常量的变量要放到后面，否则dieResult减去的不是那个值 is in Chinese. It's a good practice to keep comments in a single language, preferably English, for broader audience understanding.

**If you suspect an error in the code, suggest a particular situation in which the program will not function correctly.** 

The moveAssam method assumes that the directions value will always be one of "N", "S", "E", or "W". If, for any reason, it's not one of these values, the method won't update Assam's position. It might be good to have a default case or an error handling mechanism.
